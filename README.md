# SimpleWiki
Super lightweight help menus and custom wiki pages
Built out of the annoyance of having to constantly update (and subsequently go to from ingame) an external website wiki for ingame features.
Infinitely configurable based on simple yaml formatting
Uses no more than a command system at its core
Dynamically built and indexed
